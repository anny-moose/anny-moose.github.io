Oh well.<br><br>‎<br>A few days ago, I was bored out of my mind, sitting at my computer screen. I thought to myself <em>"Man, it would be cool to write about unique things I do, sure, nobody would read it but still!"</em>, but then I remembered: I can't really do that, as Github pages don't allow server-side code! <em>Dang!</em><br><br>But then, an idea struck me: What if I <strong>didn't</strong> use Github for the blogs? Sure, I would still use the web page for presenting them, but I certainly do not want to manually write out the HTML markup for each and every blog! That would be <strong>insanity</strong>! I don't have time for <em>that</em>!<br><br>The first thing I thought about was:<br>"Well, I can't really host it on my computer, and I don't own a server. But I do need a place for the blogs to be hosted!", which led me to the idea of using a Discord server for it, where each channel would be a separate post and the messages be it's content.<br><br>Initially, I had the idea to use a bot to get messages via a webhook(?), which would then respond with the HTML to embed into the webpage, but that quickly fell apart for obvious reasons. Looking back at it, I have <em>zero</em> idea what I was thinking about back then. There are <strong>numerous</strong> issues with this approach!<br><br>Not only is this impossible, it also is very inefficient!<br>A little bit of thinking led me to the realization, that, in order to interface with a running bot, I would either have to: <br>A) Host it somewhere.<br>B) Expose a port.<br><br>Both options are horrible for my case, and that's not even the worst part about this approach! The worst part about it, is that every user who visits my web page would have to send a request to the bot, which then would send a request to Discord, process the messages, then finally send a response! "<em>That's too much work and frankly I would rather have the users send requests to github instead</em>" — I thought to myself.<br>‎<br>Another concern I had with that type of implementation was that in that case I wouldn't be able to link those blog posts, as they would be a part of the main page. (Which is absolutely awful for sharing them!) So I put on my thinking cap went back to planning.<br><br>The second(and final) idea was to just generate them from the chat on discord, then upload to Github to a separate folder in the repository, and then (somehow) link them from the main page using client-side JavaScript.<br>If you are wondering about how the converter is implemented, it's actually dead simple:<br>I use the Discord API to first get the channels of a discord server, (server id obtained from <code>./sid.txt</code>)<br><br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1419419236941566133/1419978198011346994/image.png?ex=68d3b940&is=68d267c0&hm=bd023cf2b4531cc8d51dbae4025dc6957f819955c58c437bb495dc9d0c4616f2&"><br><br>then I put every message into a <code>Post</code>, using the channel name for the post title, and the messages in the channel as the text itself. (The list has to be reversed, because the Discord API returns them in the newest -> oldest order.)<br><br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1419419236941566133/1419979725916602410/image.png?ex=68d3baac&is=68d2692c&hm=f8908ad0131d52f70e19819c647fd12b07c5db34eeb0ba2fc1f897dcd577de70&"><br><br>Then, after every post is generated, I just generate the posts' HTML files in the <code>./blogs/</code> folder<br><br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1419419236941566133/1419980413366964234/image.png?ex=68d3bb50&is=68d269d0&hm=2d3a061c90f23766c09fe746a20e9a9dc10a47e78090a21aca1bdec759f21c5d&"><br><br>The types I define are pretty self explanatory, take a look:<br><br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1419419236941566133/1419980689356623993/image.png?ex=68d3bb92&is=68d26a12&hm=b1644d559e9cf73470f6ae90edb52cc7589d150c43a027f706b2261a1fb39261&"><br><br>With the pages generated, now the only thing left to do was:<br>Step 1. Upload them to Github (easy).<br>Step 2. Figure out how to link them, as I have <em>never</em> written a line of JavaScript before.<br>Step 3. ???<br>Step 4. Profit<br><em> </em><br>After some googling(and asking my best buddy pal chat jippety) I found out that I can write a function that runs after the page loads by adding an event listener for <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>, and the rest of it was pretty easy. (get a list of files in a folder -> generate hyperlinks for them -> add to the page.)<br><em> </em><br><br>Since you're reading this, it likely hasn't exploded on itself yet! Yay me! <br><br>The source code for the converter is available under the website's repository on my Github, and it is Free and Open Source. If you (god forbid) too want to manage your blogs with discord - you can freely use it, I certainly won't stop you.<br><br>As a thank-you for reading, you get to see how this looked for me while I was writing this!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1419419236941566133/1419998042613874768/image.png?ex=68d3cbbb&is=68d27a3b&hm=af0027b663ff1d090aa650550982df34efa33b809111982fa4f32c572fd5ac45&"><br><br></span></div></body></html>
